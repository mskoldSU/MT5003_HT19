In the project you will be working with data from the Swedish Transport Administration consisting of the driving part of the test for obtaining a Swedish driving licence, performed in Sollentuna during 2014. Data is available for all individuals under the age of 50 taking the test, but you will only use a random sample of 1000 individuals. For each individual, you have access to explanatory variables *sex*, *age* and *educator* (whether the individual trained privately ("Privatist") or in a driving school ("Trafikskola")) and the result of the test (`TRUE` for success).

Start by creating a new R-project ("New Project..." in RStudio's file menu), you are advised to use the same project for all three parts of the project. Install the package `RCurl` with `install.packages("RCurl")` and run the following code (requires an internet connection) in order to download, subsample and save data. Don't forget to change the random seed (`set.seed`) to your date of birth.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(RCurl)
set.seed(990101) #Change 990101 to your date of birth
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mskoldSU/MT5003_HT19/master/Project/proj_data.csv"
data_individ <- read.csv(text = getURL(data_url))
idx <- sample(1:nrow(data_individ), 1000)
data_individ <- data_individ[idx, ]
save(data_individ, file = "proj_data.Rdata")
```

Check the result by printing the first few rows, they should look like below but with different values.

```{r}
head(data_individ)
```
