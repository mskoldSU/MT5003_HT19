title: "Part II: Score-, Wald- and likelihood ratio tests."
output: html_document

Part II consists of four tasks. Initiate the answer for each task by writing the problem statement in your own words and finish by briefly discussing the results.

We will continue re-creating part of R's output from the logistic regression model.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
load("proj_data.Rdata")
modell <- glm(Resultat ~ Alder + Kon + Utbildare, 
              data = data_individ,
              family = "binomial")
summary(modell)
```

The functions from part I should be loaded with


```{r, echo = TRUE}
source("functions.R")
```

and we assign $y$ and $X$ as before

```{r, echo = TRUE}
y <- matrix(data_individ$Resultat, ncol = 1)
X <- model.matrix(Resultat ~ Alder + Kon + Utbildare, 
                  data = data_individ)
```

**Task 1:**

Verify, using functions `I` and `NR` from Part I, that the `z value` column of the output are Wald statistics (see the textbook page 128).

## Likelihood ratios and profiles

Now assume, as in the textbook chapter 5.3, that our parameter vector can be divided into two components $(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\eta})$. In order to perform likelihood ratio tests of the type $H_0:\boldsymbol{\theta}=\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$ and determine the profile likelihood we need to maximize the function $\boldsymbol{\eta}\mapsto L(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\eta})$ given fixed values $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. In our model this is simple when $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0=\boldsymbol{0}$; that one or several parameters equal zero is equivalent to the corresponding explanatory variables not being part of the model. If we for example let $\boldsymbol{\theta}=\theta_{Kon}$ and $\boldsymbol{\eta}=(\theta_{intercept}, \theta_{Alder}, \theta_{Utbildare})$, we can compute  $\boldsymbol{\eta}$ given that variable "kÃ¶n" (sex) is not part of the model (i.e. $\theta_{Kon}=0$) by simply removing the corresponding column of $X$ (the new matrix will be `X[, -3]`) and then pass this to function `NR`:


```{r}
eta <- NR(theta0 = c(0, 0, 0), niter = 10, y = y, X = X[, -3])
eta
```

**Task 2:**

Compute the generalized likelihood ratio statistics (see textbook chapter 5.5) that corresponds to the Wald statistics in Task 1 and determine the corresponding $P$-values. Note that your likelihood ratio statistics should be of the same order of magnitude as the *squared* Wald statistics (why?).



**Task 3:**

The score statistic can, like the likelihood ratio statistic, be generalized to the case with a nuisance parameter $\eta$. The generalized score statistic is

$$
T_S(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0)=S(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0,\hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}_{ML}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0))^T
I(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0,\hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}_{ML}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0))^{-1}S(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0,\hat{\boldsymbol{\eta}}_{ML}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_0))
$$
with an asymptotic $\chi^2(q)$ distribution (notation followingthe textbook chapter 5.5). An advantage of this statistic is thet the ML-estimate only needs to be computed under the null hypothesis. Compute the ML estimate of $\boldsymbol{\eta}=(\theta_{Alder}, \theta_{Utbildare})$ under $H_0:\boldsymbol{\theta}=(\theta_{intercept},\theta_{Kon})=(0, 0)$ and use this to determine a $P$-value based on the generalized score statistic (a model without intercept is somewhat weird for this case, so the intercept should be included regardless of its significance).

---


If we want to maximize $\boldsymbol{\eta}\mapsto L(\boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\eta})$ for a fix $\boldsymbol{\theta}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$ the function `NR` needs to be modified. Instead of doing so, we use R's `glm` function with a so called *offset*. An offset is a variable $o_i$ that is added to the linear component $x_i\theta$ without a coefficient. For the logistic regression with offset $o_i$ we then get
 $p(x_i)=(1+\exp(-x_i\theta+o_i))$.




**Task 4:**

Compute the profile likelihood (textbook definition 5.4) for parameter $\theta_{Kon}$, $L_p(\theta_{Kon})$, on a suitable grid of parameter values. Use these to graph $L_p$ together with the corresponding estimated likelihood (textbook definition 5.5). In order to determine $\hat{\eta}_{ML}(\theta_{Kon})$ you may for example use the `glm.fit` function with an extra offset as in
t
```{r,eval=TRUE}
theta.Kon <- 0.5 # example value
profil <- glm.fit(x = X[, -3], y = y,
                  offset = theta.Kon * X[, 3],
                  family = binomial())
profil$coeff
```

which gives estimates of the other coefficients when  $\theta_{Kon}=0.5$ (as an example value). Decide a 95% confidence interval based on the profile likelihood visually from the figure by drawing a horizontal line at a suitable level (c.f. Figure 5.3b in the textbook). The choice of level should be motivated and the result compared with the corresponding Wald interval.
